# Zomato-Analysis


# Overview
This project involves the a nalysis of Zomato data to extract meaningful insights about restaurant trends, customer preferences, and business patterns. The notebook zomato analysis.ipynb contains code for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the Zomato dataset, helping to understand key factors like restaurant ratings, types of cuisine, locations, and more


# File Structure
zomato_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualization.

zomato_data.csv: The dataset used for the analysis (ensure it is placed in the same directory as the notebook).

# Installation and Requirements
To run this project, you need the following packages installed in your environment:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas


NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

You can install the dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

# How to Use
Clone or download the repository.

Open the zomato_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

Run all the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

# Analysis Breakdown
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting data for better analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions of ratings, cost for two, restaurant types, and more.

City-wise Analysis: Breaking down data to identify the most popular cities in the dataset and their average ratings.

Cuisine Insights: Identifying the top cuisines offered across restaurants and their average cost.

Correlation Analysis: Finding relationships between different variables, such as cost and rating.

# Visualizations
Several graphs are generated throughout the notebook to help visualize the findings, including:

Bar charts for top restaurants by rating.

Scatter plots showing relationships between cost and ratings.


Heatmaps for correlation between variables.

# Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:

1.To explore the Zomato dataset and clean it for accurate analysis.

2.To uncover key patterns in the restaurant industry (e.g., types of cuisine, pricing trends, customer ratings).

3.To visualize the data for better interpretation and communication of results.

4.To make recommendations for stakeholders based on the analysis.


# Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into Zomatoâ€™s restaurant data, helping identify trends in the restaurant industry and customer behavior. Further improvements could include incorporating additional features like reviews or exploring trends over time.
